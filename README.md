**motivation**
- Q: how to maintain our code ?
- A: we want to test it and set a status of ok OR error for each commit.



**testing 'a commit' is called 'a build'**
- the process of cloning the repository code and running some test on it and report the commiter if the test for his commit was passing is called: **'a build'**.
