**how to test my project using selenium ?**
- tell the integrator person to create a new runner machine which contains selenium
- the gitlab-ci web interface should list the new registered machines(the runners)
- the developer can assosiate a runner with his project by selecting a runner from a list.

**can I change the runner-machine - and install another tool on it ?**
- the build process is : pulling the repo code and then running the custom-script.
- update the custom-script to add more functionality.
